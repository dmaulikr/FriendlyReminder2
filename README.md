# Friendly Reminder

Open ProjectX.xcworkspace to access the project

I have created 3 Facebook accounts to test out this project.
Here are the Emails and passwords:

Name: Jacob Smith
Email: npt@u.42o.org
Password: foo123123

Name: Mary Doe
Email: tjv@fr.ipsur.org
Password: foo123123

Name: John Book
Email: wjdr@sr.ro.lt
Password: foo123123

Each of these facebook accounts have already approved of the app and can be used. To sign out of facebook, go to safari, go to facebook.com, and sign out of your account from there. 

-User Experience-

When having an event, such as a birthday party or going on vacation, there are usually many little tasks that need to be taken care of. Friends usually want to help plan out these events but aren't sure where they could be of service. With my app, it makes it simple!

My app, Friendly Reminder, is used as an organizational tool for events. It is similar to a to do list that can be shared amongst friends. In this case, facebook friends. After logging in (through facebook), the user is shown a list of what events the user is a part of and how many assigned tasks the user has for that event. The user can also create an event of their own by tapping the + icon at the top right. It will bring up the event creator, which requires an event title and a date/time. Users can then tap on the event to bring themselves to the task view which shows all the necessary tasks that need to be completed before the event. Tasks can be added by the + icon at the top right. The "Add Friends" Button at the top right adds friends to the specific event so that they can have access to the event. Only friends that have approved of the app are shown. Once a task has been created, it can be taken by anyone and it can also be assigned to anyone. You can only assign friends that are part of the event. Once someone has finished a task, they can tap the checkmark button to complete the task. This completes the task and only the people that are assigned to the task can make it incomplete once again. Also, a user can only delete tasks or events that they have created by swiping left. A user can assign friends to a specific task by tapping the "assign" button. It will bring up the list of friends that have already been added to the event. After selecting which friends you want to do the task, tap the assign button at the top right to assign friends to the task! All of these actions happen in real time! Now, when your friends go into the app, they will know how many tasks are assigned to them and what they need to do.

My app also has a personal to do list. This uses core data and functions as a simple to do list. This can be accessed by touching the bottom right button that says "Personal" on the tab bar controller. This is useful for when a user wouldn't want to share any information with others.

Enjoy!
